      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p>Nice to meet you! I'm Sam. I currently live on the West Side of
        Cleveland and work in Cleveland midtown. I currently hold a Master's in Professional & Technical communication,
        and
        it has afforded me the ability to be intensely detail-oriented while never losing sight of the big picture. I'm
        currently enrolled in a coding class at Case Western Reserve University and am excited to expand these skills
        and
        take them in a new, forward-looking direction. I am fastidious and hold myself to rigorous standards in not
        only
        providing quality work, but work that maintains a sense of humanity. I've found that material with authentic
        personality isn't something easy to come by. I value a respectful honesty in what can and can't be done, and am
        always looking for ways to finagle a solution despite the obstacles. </p>

      <p>Avocationally, I love music. I'm either combing the internet for new music, writing songs, or trying to figure
        out how to play a song. I always appreciate the solitude and perspective that a hike can provide. I'm a
        lifelong Browns fan. Hopefully that demonstrates some tenacity, if not some blind optimism. But it's all about
        striking a balance, isn't it?</p>
